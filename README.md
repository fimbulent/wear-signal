# wear-signal

A vibe-coded Signal app I made for WearOS, so I can send a message to somebody without a phone. Tested on a Pixel Watch 4.

A compact Signal client for Wear OS. It links to your existing Signal account as a
**linked device** (like Signal Desktop) so an LTE watch can read and reply to
conversations — and optionally show notifications — while your phone stays at home.

Built against vendored modules from [Signal-Android](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android)
v8.15.0 (`lib/libsignal-service`, `core/network`, `core/util-jvm`, `core/models-jvm`).
AGPL-3.0-only, personal use.

## What it does

- **Pairing**: shows a provisioning QR; scan it from phone Signal →
  Settings → Linked devices → Link new device. **Choose "Don't transfer messages"**
  if asked — the watch can't consume the history backup.
- **Conversations**: opens straight into the conversation list (10 at a time, "Load
  more" for older) → chat-style thread view with left/right bubbles, last 100 messages
  per conversation, populated from every drain (history starts at link time). Contact
  and group photos are fetched and decrypted alongside names; anyone without a photo
  gets a coloured monogram, and group messages are colour-coded per sender. Group
  titles, member lists, and photos are fetched from the GroupsV2 server using master
  keys harvested from message contexts.
- **Sending**: reply in any thread or start a new 1:1 via the contact picker. Group
  replies fan out pairwise to the cached member list with the groupV2 context. Sends
  emit a sync transcript so phone Signal shows them too.
- **Notifications toggle** (manual control): OFF (default) — no background polling; the
  phone's own Signal notifications bridge to the watch. ON (phone dead/away) — the watch
  polls the queue on an exact-alarm interval (1/5/15 min, default 5), decrypts, notifies,
  disconnects.
- **Charge-time maintenance**: a daily WorkManager job that only runs while charging
  drains the queue silently (keeps conversations current and refreshes the server's
  45-day linked-device inactivity deadline) and runs prekey upkeep — regardless of the
  toggle, with zero wearing-time battery cost.
- **Manual poll**: "Check for messages" in the conversation list, silent.
- **Images (receive-only)**: image attachments are downloaded during polls, decrypted,
  downscaled to watch resolution (~100KB each; originals never kept), shown inline in
  threads. Retention: 7 days and a 64MB cap, oldest deleted first. Other attachment
  types show as a placeholder.
- Delivery/read ticks on sent messages; no typing indicators; no sending of
  attachments or read receipts.
- **Calls (audio-only, via RingRTC)**: place voice calls from any 1:1 thread (☎ next
  to Reply) and answer calls that arrive while the app is draining the queue — the
  watch rings with a full-screen incoming call UI. Video calls can be answered too:
  the watch joins with the camera permanently off (the caller sees your avatar) and
  incoming video is never rendered — audio only, both ways. Because the watch only
  holds a connection during drains, calls ring live only when the app is open/polling
  at that moment; anything older lands in the call history as a missed call.
- **Call history**: missed/answered/declined calls appear as rows in threads and as
  conversation previews, populated from drained 1:1 signaling and the phone's call
  event sync messages. Missed calls notify on background polls (same
  phone-covers-us suppression as messages). Group calls aren't joinable, but
  conversations show an "Ongoing call" indicator once an SFU peek confirms
  participants.

## Build

Requires JDK 17+ (e.g. Android Studio's bundled JBR — point `JAVA_HOME` at it, or set
`org.gradle.java.home` in your own `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`) and an Android SDK
configured via `local.properties`.

```
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

### Installing the APK on a watch

Wear OS has no way to sideload from the watch itself — installs go over wireless ADB
from a computer with [platform-tools](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools)
(`adb`) on the same Wi-Fi network as the watch.

1. **Enable developer options** on the watch: Settings → System → About → tap
   **Build number** 7 times.
2. **Enable debugging**: Settings → Developer options → turn on **ADB debugging**
   and **Wireless debugging**.
3. **Pair the computer** (first time per computer): in Wireless debugging choose
   **Pair new device**, then on the computer run
   `adb pair <ip>:<pairing-port>` and type the 6-digit code shown on the watch.
4. **Connect**: back on the Wireless debugging screen, note the main IP and port, then
   `adb connect <ip>:<port>`. The watch shows up in `adb devices`.
5. **Install**: `adb install -r wear-signal.apk` (a couple of minutes over Wi-Fi).
   - If it fails with `INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE`, the installed copy was
     signed with a different key: `adb uninstall dev.sam.wearsignal` first. That wipes
     the app's data, so you'll re-link afterwards.
6. **Link**: open the app on the watch and scan the QR from phone Signal →
   Settings → Linked devices → Link new device (choose "Don't transfer messages"
   if asked). Then poll once to pull in names, photos, and group state.

Afterwards you can turn Wireless debugging off — it costs battery when left on.

### Signing / working from multiple machines

Both debug and release builds are signed with `keystore/wear-signal.keystore` when it
exists (gitignored — copy it to each dev machine; default password `wear-signal`,
override with `-PwearSignalKeystorePassword=...`). A consistent signature is what lets
installs from any machine update in place: installing an APK with a *different*
signature requires uninstalling first, which wipes the app data and forces a re-link.
If the keystore is absent, debug falls back to the machine-local debug key.

## Testing on the emulator

```
~/Android/Sdk/emulator/emulator -avd wearos5 &
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

The provisioning URL is also printed to logcat (`LinkingViewModel`) as a dev fallback
if scanning the emulator screen is awkward.

The Status screen has a debug chip to force the phone-connected state
(auto / connected / away) for testing notification dedup without a paired phone.

## Notes

- Prekey upkeep (top-up + 2-day signed/last-resort rotation) runs during the daily
  charge-time maintenance job.
- Group send requires the member list, which is fetched on the first poll that sees a
  message from that group — so a brand-new group needs one incoming drain before you
  can reply to it.
- Unlinking: phone Signal → Linked devices → remove "Watch". Relink anytime (5-device limit).
- Profile names are resolved via profile keys harvested from incoming messages, so the
  first message from a contact may show a truncated ACI until the fetch completes.
